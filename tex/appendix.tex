\section{Background of Skin and it's Interstitial Fluid}
\label{Appendix_A}
\subsection{Background of Skin}
As the MN device needs to penetrate the skin barrier, knowledge of it is vital. Skin is the largest organ of the human body with an average surface area of two square metres in adults \cite{brown2021histology}. Skin thickness varies depending on the body part from 0.5mm thick on the eyelids (thinnest skin) to 4.0mm thick on the heels of the feet (thickest skin) \cite{brown2021histology}. Functions of the skin include protection (against UV light, mechanical, thermal and chemical stresses, dehydration and biological threats), sensation (contains receptors that sense touch, pressure, pain and temperature), thermoregulation (contains sweat glands, hair, and adipose tissue) and metabolic functions (subcutaneous adipose tissue is involved in the production of vitamin D, and triglycerides) \cite{brown2021histology}. We focus on the basic skin structure that affects the mechanical design of MN biosensors for successful penetration. Skin is composed of three layers \cite{brown2021histology,GARCIAGUZMAN2021116148}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The epidermis (thin outer layer): A keratinised stratified squamous epithelial layer of the skin that is important for the protective function of the skin. Its thickness varies between 50 - 150 um \cite{GARCIAGUZMAN2021116148}. It is divided into five sublayers \cite{brown2021histology} among which are the stratum corneum (SC) which is lipophilic and the stratum basale (SB) which is hydrophilic \cite{GARCIAGUZMAN2021116148}. The SC is the outer layer of the epidermis which serves as the primary barrier between the body and the environment \cite{brown2021histology}. Sc thickness is about 10um \cite{GARCIAGUZMAN2021116148}. The SB also known as stratum germinativum, is the deepest layer of the epidermis, separated from the dermis by the basement membrane (basal lamina) and attached to the basement membrane by hemidesmosomes \cite{brown2021histology}.
    \item The dermis (thicker middle layer): The connective tissue layer of skin containing collagen and elastic fibres that is important for sensation, protection and thermoregulation. The thickness of the dermis varies between approximately 500 and 2000 um \cite{GARCIAGUZMAN2021116148}. The pressure needed to penetrate this layer is about 1-5MPa \cite{smalls2006effect}. It contains nerves, blood vessels, fibroblasts, sweat glands, hair follicles (in some areas) and derma lymph nodes \cite{GARCIAGUZMAN2021116148,brown2021histology}. 
    \item The hypodermis (inner layer): The thickest of all the three layers. It contains adipose tissue, sweat glands, nerves and blood vessels. 
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Using ISF as the source for sepsis biomarker detection}
Most of the required mechanical properties of MN biosensors (length, shape, rigidness, and thickness among others) depend on the biofluid source. Blood is considered the primary biofluid source for analysing and acquiring biochemical information. Blood composition constantly changes as the patientâ€™s health condition changes. The dermal and hypodermal layers of the skin contain blood vessels, thus, enabling MN biosensors the ability to perform blood analysis. However, several challenges arise from performing blood analysis: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item There are high concentrations of interfering species present in the blood resulting in severe fouling issues for the biosensors.
    \item MN biosensors are intended for continuous monitoring, hence, the device needs to provide the most painless user experience; More painless than traditional finger pricks.
\end{enumerate}
Skin ISF has similar profiles of proteins, small molecules, and RNA to blood and contains specific biomarkers that are exclusive or sufficient compared to blood as it comes into contact with tissues, cells, and blood capillaries \cite{liu2020microneedles}. It contains the biologically relevant biomarkers required for diagnosing sepsis. Furthermore, using skin ISF as the source for sepsis biomarkers could potentially address the issues of direct blood analysis. ISF is found in the subcutaneous tissue and, hence, MNs with shorter lengths can be used to access ISF translating to painless skin insertion of the MN device. This allows the possibility for minimally invasive, continuous biomarker monitoring over a period of hours to days, or even longer and provides on-body portability and wearability. In addition, it allows compatibility with the diagnosis of infants. Skin ISF as a biofluid source will dramatically reduce the problems of surface fouling due to having lower concentrations of proteins and other large molecules \cite{heikenfeld2018lab}; This facilitates long-term electrochemical readout. In conclusion, skin ISF was determined to be the ideal choice for the source of sepsis biomarkers for our MN biosensors to enable real-time continuous monitoring of sepsis biomarkers in a minimally invasive manner. 
\section{Microneedle Design}
\subsection{Microneedle Analytical performance}
The procedures and materials used for the fabrication design of the MN sensors strongly influence the final analytical performance and in vivo suitability of the MN device. Usually, solid MNs that are externally modified are used for developing MN biosensors as it facilitates good interaction with the target biomarker \cite{calio2016polymeric,bollella2019minimally}. However, upon skin penetration, the recognition element is susceptible to friction with the skin layers and exposed to undesired molecules present in the skin which could damage or change the recognition element. Potential solutions to mitigate this include: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Using an external water-soluble polymeric layer that protects the recognition element from mechanical alteration during skin penetration. Once it has penetrated the skin barrier, the layer dissolves in the ISF allowing for direct exposure to the target biomarker \cite{jin2019reduced}.
    \item Internal modification of hollow MNs to provide physical protection of the recognition element during insertion and reduces unwanted contact with tissues, hence, reducing the fouling effect \cite{zhao2020silk,miller2012multiplexed}.
\end{enumerate}
Regardless of the method of incorporating the recognition element into the MN, resistance to skin insertion must be evaluated before any in vivo application to ensure the analytical performance of the MN sensor is not affected by skin insertion or once inside the skin. 
Therefore, there is a need to confirm that external calibrations performed in in-vitro experiments can be used for calibrating biomarker concentrations in skin ISF. To confirm this, the MN biosensor is inserted through an agarose hydrogel that is in contact with artificial ISF to mimic the skin system in the human body \cite{bollella2019minimally}. Then, we measure and record the signals obtained from the MN device through the agarose hydrogel at increasing biomarker concentrations in artificial ISF and compare the calibration graph before and after insertion of the MN in the gel. To better mimic the skin system in the human body, we can use animal skin fixed onto a physical support which allows contact with artificial ISF where biomarker concentrations can be manually changed instead of gel. 
% ====================================================================
\subsection{Cytotoxicity Testing}
As the MN penetrates the skin barrier and comes into contact with skin ISF, it is vital to ensure that there is no toxicity effect caused by direct contact, leaching, or detachment of the recognition element \cite{GARCIAGUZMAN2021116148}. Cytotoxicity assays can be used to assess cell viability after exposure to the recognition element and/or its different components which is compared to a control group for certain lengths of time (e.g. after 24-72 hours). The effects of direct contact between the recognition element and the cells and effects of leaching/detachment of singular components to the cells can also be examined by other experimental procedures such as cell proliferation experiments. We should also study skin inflammation and immune response after MN biosensor insertion with the latter being related to the biocompatibility of the device \cite{kim2019continuous}.
\subsection{Microneedle Shape}
The 3 essential factors to consider while developing MN biosensors are: resistance
to skin penetration, the pain inflicted on the end-user, and the location of the target biofluid \cite{GARCIAGUZMAN2021116148}. When considering resistance to skin penetration, parameters such as MN length, type of material, shape, tip angle, and insertion force are studied for developing a robust device capable of reaching the SC or deeper with minimal penetration force and, therefore, provide a more painless user-expereimence. The skin epidermis and dermis at the body region of MN application must be independently evaluated to design the MN biosensor; The different mechanical properties, depths and skin viscoelasticities have to be taken into consideration for the MN design. \\\\
An ideal MN biosensor is said to have: (1) an elegant tip shape (conical) \cite{chang2020optimal} and minimised tip radius (5-80um) to minimise the insertion force required, (2) adequate MN thickness (5-60um), base diameter (100-200um) and Young's Modulus to prevent fracture and (3) adequate MN length to reach the biofluid source (below 600 um for ISF) \cite{GARCIAGUZMAN2021116148}. The length of the MN has to be long enough to reach the target biofluid by penetrating the appropriate skin layers but not be too long to cause axial fracture, thus, a compromise has to be made. Several studies have attempted to quantify the pain experienced by volunteers as a result of MNs and MN arrays. The effect of MN length, base diameter, thickness, number of MNs per array, and tip angle, have been studied \cite{li2013optimized, gill2008effect, lee2018three}; A direct correlation between the patient's pain and MN length (up to 1450 um) and the number of MNs placed (up to 50) was observed. MN arrays with varying thickness or tip angle, up to values of 100 um and 90 degrees, respectively, no change in discomfort levels were observed. Finally, every patient indicated that the discomfort caused by MNs was always less than that caused by regular hypodermic needle insertion (outer diameter of 460 um and insertion depth of 5 mm). 
\subsection{Forces experienced by Microneedles}
MN robustness, insertion force and tip fracture force were assessed in various studies \cite{davis_landis_adams_allen_prausnitz_2004, jung-hwan, rÃ¶mgens_bader_bouwstra_baaijens_oomens_2014} for a range of MN tip radii, lengths, geometries and wall thickness and  wall angles. Different imaging technologies can be used to precisely assess the state of the MN tips. This includes the USB camera attached microscope. To visualise the MNs tips with a higher magnification, scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi 3500, Pleasanton, CA) was used \cite{davis_landis_adams_allen_prausnitz_2004}. Different base radii are usually not tested due to the consideration that the stress maximizes on the microneedle tip \cite{formulas_stress}. Various authors have reported a linear dependence of the tip insertion force with the interfacial area of the needle tip. An increase in wall thickness, wall angle and tip radius was found to increase the force required to fracture the microneedles; This was supported by finite element simulations and a thin shell analytical model. Most studies used the change in electrical resistance of the outermost layer of the skin to determine the penetration point of the needle due to the high chance of inaccuracy of the visual assessment. Studies on the insertion force of the microneedle through the skin were reported to be in the range of 0.08 to 3.04 N,  for tip radii of 30 to 80 mm and wall thickness of 5mm \cite{davis_landis_adams_allen_prausnitz_2004}. It has also been shown that the average insertion force for hollow microneedles did not differ much from that of solid MNs; This leads to the conclusion that a full cross-sectional area is a better representation of an inserted microneedle in the skin, rather than the annular surface area. The fracture force was determined by pressing the microneedles against a test block until fracture occurred. Fracture force measurements were taken for wall thickness ranging from 5Âµm-15Âµm, tip radii of 40-58Âµm and wall angles of 60-70 degrees giving fracture forces values of 0.5N-6N, , 1.5N-6N and 1.2N - 3N respectively. Decreased tip radius drastically decreased insertion force and moderately decreased fracture force while increased wall thickness and wall angle drastically increased fracture force but had no effect on the insertion force over the range of MN shape considered. Thus, fracture force depend mostly on wall thickness and only slightly on tip radius and wall angle. This is supported by theoretical considerations where an increase in wall thickness, increases the area over which the force is applied and, thus, decreases the stress on the needle. In addition, as the microneedle wall angle gets more vertical and the shape of the microneedle approaches cylindrical, a higher fraction of the stress would get oriented along the plane of the wall rather than normal to the wall, thus, increasing the fracture force. Fracture forces were shown to always be greater than the insertion forces. Therefore, using MNs of small tip radius and large wall thickness could potentially result in a 5-fold margin of safety, which  is the ratio between the insertion and fracture forces. 

\subsection{Chemical Stability of Aptamers}
Microneedle Electrochemical Aptamer based biosensors introduced into the human body will unavoidably interact with human serum. Aptamers, being single stranded oligonucleotides, are susceptible to nuclease degradation in serum, thereby affecting it's function in vivo \cite{kratschmer2017effect}. RNA has a half life on the order of seconds, prolonged to minutes/hours for DNA molecules \cite{morrissey2005activity,kurreck2002design}. Chemical Modifications to the sugars such as 2â€™-fluoro (2â€™F) or 2â€™-amino
(2â€™NH2) ribose groups on the pyrimidine residues have shown to improve serum half-life \cite{barciszewski2009locked}. Stabilizing backbone modifications can
also be incorporated into aptamers by substituting backbone phosphate linkages (PO) with sulfur-containing phosphorothioate
linkages (PS) \cite{green1995nuclease} and phosphorodiothioate linkages \cite{yang2004progress}. In addition to sugar and phosphate modifications, the 3â€™ end of the molecules are usually capped with an inverted
dT residue, which provides resistance to serum exonucleases \cite{dass2002cellular}.\\\\
 Serum stability is a critical feature for assessing the viability of this sensing platform for preclinical in vivo studies, however there have been a lack of comprehensive and systematic studies of the effect of composition
 on aptamer serum stability.

\section{Hydrogen Peroxide Coulometry} \label{app:h2o2_coulometry}
\noindent Coulometry serves as a powerful tool to amplify the signal as well as reduce the noise through integrating the amperometry current data with respect to time. By Anson equation \cite{Anson1966}, the charge can be expressed as an integral of current, as shown in \autoref{eqn:anson}. 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:anson}
    Q(t) = \int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}i(t) \mathrm{d}t = \frac{nFA\sqrt{D}\sqrt{t}}{\sqrt{r}}C_{\infty}
\end{equation}
where $n$ is the number of charge transferred in the reaction, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, $r$ is the radius of the working electrode and $A$ is the area of the working electrode.\\\\
Based on Anson equation, an improved Anson equation was proposed by Flanagan \textit{et al} \cite{Flanagan1973} by considering the edge-effect in the experiment, shown in \autoref{eqn:improved_anson}.
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:improved_anson}
    Q(t) = \frac{nFA\sqrt{D}}{\sqrt{\pi}}C_{A}\bigg( \sqrt{t}+\frac{1.92\sqrt{D}}{r}t\bigg)
\end{equation}
\noindent The realisation of coulometry is shown in the listing below.

\subsection{Lactate Calibration Protocol}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Electrochemical cell setup
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Take the lactate sensor out of the freezer and hydrate by pipetting a drop of PBS on to the surface of the exposed electrode.
            \item Set up the electrochemical cell as per the diagram, ensuring the platinum and silver electrodes are in place.
            \item Add 20ml of pH 7.4 PBS to the cell 
            \item Screw the lactate sensor in to the RDE machine and suspend in solution.
            \item Connect wires to CHI potentiostat and turn the program on 0.7V for a 3 hour cycle.
            \item Turn the RDE machine on to rotate the electrode at 400rpm
            \item Allow an hour for the sensor readings to stabilise
        \end{enumerate}
        
    \item Production of lactate stock solution
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item To produce a 100mM/L solution of sodium lactate in PBS, measure 224.12mg of the sodium lactate with a weighing scale
            \item Add the lactate to 20ml of pH 7.4 PBS solution and stir gently
        \end{enumerate}
    
    \item Calibration
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item One the readings have stabilised, pipette 20uL of the lactate stock solution into the cell and record the time added- the step corresponds to the addition of 0.2mM/L lactate.
            \item Once the reading after the step has stabilised, add another 20uL
            \item Repeat the process until a concentration of 3mM/L has been reached
            \item Thereafter, pipette 100uL to achieve a concentration of 3.5mM/L
            \item Repeat the process once the reading has stabilised for 2 more additions of 100uL until 4.5mM/L has been achieved and end program
        \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Lactate Future Considerations}
\label{app:Lactate_future}
\subsection{Enzyme selection}
Various enzymes with different kinetics can be used for electrochemical sensing of lactate. In this experiment lactate oxidase was used due to its high wealth of literature and ease of accessibility\cite{romero2010amperometric}. Alternatively Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) can be used which reduces lactate in the presence of NAD\textsuperscript{+}, producing NADH which can be detected by the electrode \cite{narayanan2020lactic}.
\begin{align}
    Lactate + NAD^{+} \xrightarrow{} Pyruvate + NADH + H^{+}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
    NADH \xrightarrow{} NAD + H^{+} + 2e^{-}
\end{align}
In previous experiments, LDH has shown to have a high sensitivity and limit of detection and so it would be sensible as a next step to explore the use of LDH in sensor fabrication. \\\\
A Levich study of these lactate sensors would allow us to define the parameters regarding mass transport and kinetics around the RDE, including the diffusion coefficient $D$ and standard rate constant $k^{\circ}$, allowing us to compare the kinetics of the enzymes. This experiment would involve changing the rotational speed of the RDE and conducting voltammograms \cite{treimer2002consideration}.  The Levich equation follows
\begin{equation}
    j_{L} \mathrm{(Am^{-2})} = 0.62nFD^{0.67}\mathrm{(m^{2}s^{-1})} v^{-0.166}\mathrm{(m^{2}s^{-1})}c\mathrm{(mol\ m^{-3})}\omega\mathrm{(rad \ s^{-1})}
\end{equation}
where $n$ is number of electrodes involved in reaction, $F$ is Faradayâ€™s constant (=96,500C/mol), $D$ is diffusion constant, $v$ is kinematic velocity, $C$ is concentration of electroactive species in solution, $\omega$ is rotational speed.\\\\
From this equation we can deduce that $j_{L}$ is proportional to c (when $v$ and $\omega$ are held constant). Furthermore, for the case of mass transport to be true $j_{L}$ vs $\omega^{0.5}$ should display a linear relationship passing through the origin.
Graphically, a Levich plot yields a sigmoidal function of j against the potential for different rotational speeds. \\\\
We can then use the Levich study to apply a Koutecy exploitation whereby the inverse of the current is plotted against the rotational speed, sampled at different potentials (where there is a steep rise and plateau from the Levich plot) \cite{nikolic2000theoretical}. The linear relationship should obey the Koutecy-Levich law. 
\begin{align}
    \frac{1}{i_{L}} = \frac{1}{i_{K}}+\bigg(\frac{1}{0.620nFD^{2/3}v^{-1/6}C}\bigg)\omega^{-1/2}
\end{align}
If plotted, the rate constant can be determined by the y intercept of the graph.
For plots sampled at current on the rising portion of the Levich plot, extrapolating back to $\omega=0$ will give non-zero intercepts indicating the slow kinetics at electrode surface limits the reaction rate even at high rotational speeds (hence high mass transport). 
We can use Koutecy-Levich studies to observe the differences in enzyme kinetics for LOX and LDH sensors and make informed decisions, based on the kinetic parameters, which is a more accurate representation of live interstitial lactate levels.

\section{Aptamer Multiexponential Current Derivation}
\label{Aptamer_multiexp}
In this study, we assume the aptamer state as being a distribution of two states, bound and unbound. Binding-induced conformation change in the aptamer increases the electron transfer rate from $k_{A}$ to $k_{AT}$ (Fig. \ref{aptamerrate}). It is hypothesized that target binding causes an
increase of the efficiency of electron transfer (ET) between the
electrode and the redox reporter as they are moved closer together \cite{farjami2011off} (Methylene Blue \cite{arroyo2018subsecond}).\\\\
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 1.0\textwidth]{img/aptamerdiagram2.png}
    \caption{Aptamer Electron transfer rate. Increases due to Target binding to the Aptamer.\cite{arroyo2018subsecond}}
    \label{aptamerrate}
\end{figure}
Target ([T]) binding to the Aptamer ([A]), forms the aptamer-ligand complex ([AT]) as shown in the following chemical reaction:
\begin{align}
\cee{[A] + [T]  &<=> [AT]} 
\end{align}
The binding rate of the target to the aptamer is $k_{on}$ and the off-binding rate of the target to the aptamer is $k_{off}$. Assuming the system is in equilibrium, the rate of the forward reaction is equal to the rate of the backward reaction:
\begin{equation}
k_{on}[A][T] = k_{off}[AT]
\end{equation}
Using the conservation of mass for the total aptamer concentrations:
\begin{equation}
[A_{0}] = [A] + [AT]
\end{equation}
Faradaic reduction of the methylene blue reporter to leucomethylene blue occurs during chronoamperometric detection
 \cite{zhan1990mechanisms}:
\begin{align}
\cee{MB^{+} + 2e^{-} + H^{+}  &-> LMB} 
\end{align}
Electron transfer empirically follows a first order rate reaction \cite{bard1983electrochemical, forster1994electrochemistry}. Therefore the output current follows an exponential decay.
% $$ k_{ET} = -\frac{d[e^{-}]}{dt} $$
% $$ \therefore [e^{-}] = e^{-k_{ET}t} $$

\subsection{Chronoamperometric Signal}
Upon a step wave excitation in potential during chronoamperometry, the output current is a sum of exponential decay signals \cite{arroyo2018subsecond}, one due to the bound aptamer, and another due to the unbound aptamer, with the relative contributions of the exponential decays to be equal to the concentrations of the bound and unbound aptamers respectively. The two exponential decay components are likely to be a distribution, centered at the mean average value. Modelling the rate constants 'k' as a probability distribution would more physically represent the physical scenario.
$$ \frac{i}{nFA} = [AT]e^{-k_{AT}t} + [A]e^{-k_{A}t} $$
Deriving the expressions for the concentrations of the bound and unbound aptamer configurations as functions of the total aptamer concentration - we use equations (2) and (3) to derive [AT]:
$$ [AT] = \frac{k_{on}[T][A_{0}-AT]}{k_{off}} $$
$$ [AT] = \frac{k_{on}[T][A_{0}]}{k_{off}} - \frac{k_{on}[T][AT]}{k_{off}} $$
$$ [AT](1+\frac{k_{on}[T]}{k_{off}}) = \frac{k_{on}[T][A_{0}]}{k_{off}} $$
$$  [AT] = \frac{k_{on}[T]}{k_{off}+k_{on}[T]}[A_{0}] $$
Using a similar method, we can get an expression for [A], concentration of the unbound aptamer. Alternatively, we can calculate [A] using the conservation of mass formula, where [A] = [$A_{0}$]-[AT]:
$$ [A] = \frac{k_{off}}{k_{off}+k_{on}[T]}[A_{0}] $$
Final equation for the output current:\\\\
\begin{equation}
\frac{i}{nFA} = \frac{k_{on}[T]}{k_{on}[T]+k_{off}}e^{-k_{AT}t} + \frac{k_{off}}{k_{on}[T]+k_{off}}e^{-k_{A}t}
\end{equation}
