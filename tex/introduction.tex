\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Project Aim}
When demand for healthcare is rapidly increasing, healthcare systems globally are struggling with depleting resources. However, early accurate diagnosis of sepsis is vital as each hour of delay in initiating antibiotic therapy increases mortality by 5â€“10$\%$ \cite{heikenfeld2018lab,bauer2010molecular}. Diagnosis of sepsis is not straightforward and interpreting clinical signs and symptoms is a challenge resulting in a potential delay in diagnosis. Uncertainty about diagnosis is mitigated by needless antimicrobial therapy or  broad-spectrum antibiotics, but this gives rise to antibiotic resistance \cite{hung2020current}. Currently, there is no gold standard for diagnosing sepsis and constant monitoring by medical staff is required. Therefore, our research aims to develop an on-body portable and wearable biosensing point-of-care (POC) MN device for infection diagnostics that can be self-managed by the public and is capable of real-time detection with high specificity and sensitivity. The device detects sepsis biomarkers in skin ISF as it mirrors blood composition; It allows the device to be small, thus, enabling it to avoid contact with nerve endings and blood capillaries, making it tolerable by patients \cite{liu2020microneedles}. \autoref{Appendix_A} provides a more comprehensive evaluation for utilising skin ISF as the target biofluid source.\\\\
Our project focuses on electrochemically detecting different sepsis biomarkers: 1) Nitrite, 2) Hydrogen Peroxide, and 3) Lactate. We studied a panel of sepsis biomarkers to diagnose sepsis with high specificity. In addition, this project aims to develop more representative models for aptamer-based biosensors interrogated using chronoamperometry. This detection method allows drift-free, sub-second resolved measurements of the target molecule \cite{arroyo2018subsecond}. More accurate and representative modelling of the aptamers and their output signals will improve the precision of biomarker measurements.\\\\
