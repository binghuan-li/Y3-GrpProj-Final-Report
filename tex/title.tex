\section*{Acknowledgements}
We would firstly like to sincerely thank Prof. Danny O'Hare for supervising us throughout this entire project. His guidance has tremendously contributed to our knowledge in the field of biosensors.\\\\
Secondly, we would like to express our gratitude to Dr Sally Gowers, Mr James Mcleod, Miss Shulin Zhang, Miss Saylee Jangnam, and Miss Sanziana Foia for accommodating us in the B105 biosensor lab and for their guidance in the usage of various experimental equipment and software. We are grateful for their technical support in our experimental and modelling work.\\\\
We would lastly also like to thank Dr Tom Ouldridge for inspiring our work on coarse-grained modelling.
