### Abstract
Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction casued by a dysrugulated host response to infections. Electrochemical microneedle biosensors are capable of minimally invisive, continueous sepsis biomarkers monitoring in skin interstitial fluid. We studied three sepsis biomarkers - nitrite, hydrogen perioxide and lactate, and obatained the corressponding linear calibration curves. We present a modelling framework analysing chronoamperometric experiments performed on aptamer-based biosensors involving a novel numerical inverse Laplace algorithm, capable of decomposing representative rate constants values.
